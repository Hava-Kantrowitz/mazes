# mazes
Java implementation of mazes

There is one set of maze that looks dang cool but I couldn't get it working. There is another set of mazes that are pre-created and solved via breadth first search and depth first search algorithms. There is a third set that creates the maze and solves it, both using recursive backtracking. 

While creating the maze generator I accidentally created a pixel art generator. It's cool so I'm gonna keep it here. 

I want to make a fourth maze set at some point that uses the code from the third set, but has a sprite and you can move it through the maze with keys.
