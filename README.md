# mazes
Java implementation of mazes

There is one set of maze that looks dang cool but I couldn't get it working. There is another set of mazes that are pre-created and solved via breadth first search and depth first search algorithms. I couldn't get any generator working, may come back to it but right now I've been working on this for a while and want to do something else. 

While creating the maze generator I accidentally created a pixel art generator. It's cool so I'm gonna keep it here.
